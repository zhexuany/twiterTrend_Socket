Directory:
src:        sources codes
include:    header files
client:     sources codes, header files and Makefile for client
server:     sources codes, header files and Makefile for server

server/include:    makeargv.h twitterTrendServer.h


How to compile the program:
use "make" to make executable file "twitterTrend_server" and 
"twitterTrend_client" under corresponding folder


How to run from Shell:
./twitterTrend_server <portNumber> <numThreads>
./twitterTrend_client <serverHostName> <serverPortNumber> <filePath>


for example:
./twitterTrend_server 3039 2 (in machine 0)
./twitterTrend_client kh4250-18-cselabs.umn.edu 3039 client1.in (in machine 1)
./twitterTrend_client kh4250-30-cselabs.umn.edu 3039 client2.in (in machine 2)


Purpose:
This program implements a multi-threaded twitterTrend server and twitterTrend 
client. In this program, synchronization mechanisms is achieved by using mutex 
lock and condition variable. Server's main thread creates a shared queue of 
incoming clients' sockets, while each child thread gets, removes and handles 
the clients concurrently. Client sends city names to the given server port 
number throught network and receives corresponding key words. In case an 
unrecognized or malformed message is received, the network connection will 
terminate and an error message will be sent over to the other side of the 
connection.


Extra details:
We did extra credits which means that, Client program can take an arbitrary 
number of input files as the command line arguments instead of only one input 
file.
